# ⚡ LAB
The LAB articles will analyze the operation of MOSFETs and analyze DC, AC, TRAN operating regions.



# ⚡ VCO analysis
In this project, we will conduct a detailed study of two types of Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO) circuits: Ring VCO and LC VCO. The main objective is to analyze and compare the characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages of each type of circuit. T
